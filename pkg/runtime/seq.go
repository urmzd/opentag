// DefaultStride is the size of one attempt's sequence band.
//
// It bounds the number of events a single attempt may publish (Stride-2 deltas
// between the attempt's opening and closing lifecycle events). A million deltas
// in one turn is not a busy agent, it is a loop, so the bound doubles as a
// backstop.
const DefaultStride = 1 << 20

// SeqAccepted is where every run's stream starts: the accepted event, published
// once when the ledger takes the run, before any attempt exists.
const SeqAccepted = 1

// maxSeq is the largest sequence number every bus backend can carry. The Redis
// backend passes sequences through Lua numbers, so 2^53 is the real ceiling and
// bands are refused past it rather than silently wrapping into a number the
// broker cannot represent.
const maxSeq = 1 << 53

// ErrSeqExhausted reports an attempt that published more events than its band
// holds. It is terminal: the next attempt would produce the same flood.
var ErrSeqExhausted = errors.New("runtime: attempt sequence band exhausted")

// band is one attempt's slice of a run's sequence space.
//
// # Why sequences are banded by attempt
//
// Event.Seq is per-run, and the bus treats a sequence at or below a run's
// high-water mark as an idempotent no-op: first write wins. That rule is what
// stops duraturo replay from duplicating a stream, and it means the runtime must
// choose sequence numbers with a clear head about what should be deduplicated
// and what must not be.
//
// Two things happen to a run that make the naive answer wrong. A memoized replay
// re-executes the workflow body but not the agent, so it publishes only
// lifecycle events. A retry after a crash re-executes the agent for real, and
// its output is DIFFERENT from the partial output the interrupted attempt
// published. Numbering both from the same base would make the retry's entire
// answer land at or below the high-water mark, so the bus would drop it — and,
// worse, drop the completed event too. A subscriber would watch a run go quiet
// forever while the ledger recorded success.
//
// So each attempt gets its own band, laid out as:
//
//	seq 1                        accepted (no attempt yet)
//	[1+a*Stride]                 started (a == 1) or resumed (a > 1)
//	(1+a*Stride, band ceiling)   the attempt's deltas, in order
//	[band ceiling]               completed, failed, or parked
//
// The consequences are all the ones we want. Within one attempt, numbering is a
// pure function of the attempt, so re-executing the same attempt publishes the
// identical stream and the bus deduplicates it exactly. Across attempts,
// numbering only ever increases, so a retry appends its real output after the
// interrupted attempt's partial output instead of vanishing behind it. Gaps
// between bands are free: Subscription.From is "strictly after this sequence",
// so a consumer never notices, and no backend stores anything for a number that
// was never published.
//
// The cost is honest and small: a run that publishes completed, crashes before
// the ledger records it, and replays will publish completed twice with two
// sequence numbers. Sinks are already required to tolerate redelivery, and
// duplicating a terminal event is strictly better than losing one.
