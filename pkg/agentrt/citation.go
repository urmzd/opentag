// Retriever grounds a turn in a corpus.
//
// It is the narrow half of saige's rag Pipeline: a turn retrieves, it does not
// ingest, so opentag depends on one method instead of on a pipeline with a
// store, an embedder, and a chunker behind it. A deployment with a real RAG
// pipeline adapts it in four lines (Search, then take .Context); a deployment
// with none passes nothing and the agent answers from the model alone.
//
// The returned context is used twice: its Prompt is prepended to the turn's
// input so the model can see the passages, and its Blocks become citation
// events so a reader can check them.

// Citations converts an assembled RAG context into citation event bodies, in
// the order the context lists them.
//
// This is where opentag's citations come from, and it is worth being explicit
// about why. saige's CitationDelta reports what a model or tool cited, which
// opentag does not translate. The retrieval result already carries exactly what
// a footnote needs: the exact source text, the inline label the assembled
// prompt used, and resolvable provenance. Deriving citations from retrieval rather than from the model also
// makes them honest: they report what the turn was GIVEN, which a model cannot
// misattribute, rather than what it claims to have used.
//
// A nil or empty context yields no chunks. A block with neither text nor a
// label is skipped: it would render as an empty footnote.
