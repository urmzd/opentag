// Package cron is the schedule peer in the mesh: a trigger, and only a trigger.
//
// # Why there is no Sink here
//
// A schedule is not a place. Slack has a thread to answer in and GitHub has an
// issue to comment on, but "every weekday at 09:00" has no surface, so there is
// nothing for a Sink to render onto and this connector deliberately implements
// none. pkg/connector.RolesOf derives that from the type, so a route naming a
// cron:// target is refused by Registry.Sink with ErrUnsupported rather than
// accepted and dropped.
//
// That is also what makes the connector interesting rather than trivial. A cron
// tag carries Routes like any other tag, so a schedule can deliver its answer
// into a Slack channel, a Jira ticket and an outbound webhook at once, none of
// which it knows anything about. A schedule with no routes at all still runs and
// still publishes every event to the bus, where anyone subscribed to the agent's
// topic sees it. Origin and destination are independent; cron is the case that
// proves it, because it has no origin surface to fall back to.
//
// # The whole correctness story is the occurrence id
//
// Everything else in this package is scheduling arithmetic. The one property
// that matters is that a given firing of a given schedule has ONE identity, no
// matter which process computed it or how many times:
//
//	Tag.ID = "<schedule>@<unix seconds of the scheduled instant>"
//
// The id comes from the instant the expression selected, never from the instant
// this process noticed it was due. So a restart, a redelivery, and a second
// replica all produce the same string, and Tag.ID is the run's idempotency key —
// they join one run instead of starting three. See OccurrenceID.
//
// On top of that, the ticker never looks backwards. A schedule seen for the
// first time starts from the current instant, so a process that was down over
// the weekend does not wake up and fire Saturday and Sunday at once. Missed
// occurrences are missed, on purpose: an agent asked to summarize yesterday is
// useless a day late, and the alternative — replaying a backlog on boot — is how
// a scheduler turns an outage into a thundering herd.
//
// # No goroutine you did not ask for, and no sleeping in tests
//
// Tick does one pass and is exported. Ingest runs it on an interval, or, with a
// non-positive Interval, runs no ticker at all and leaves the driving to the
// caller — which is what a deployment with a leader-elected scheduler wants, and
// what a test wants. Config.Now is the clock seam, so scheduling is exercised by
// moving a variable rather than by sleeping.
//
// This package is stdlib plus the mesh's own leaf packages. It speaks to no
// network and holds no credential: a schedule is entirely a local decision.
