// Package mention finds the agent a human tagged and removes the mention from
// the text the agent will read.
//
// Every trigger faces the same two questions — "who was tagged?" and "what is
// left once the tag is removed?" — and every native surface encodes a mention
// differently: Slack sends <@U08BOT>, Jira sends [~accountid:5b10a2], GitHub
// sends the literal @login. The encodings are the connectors' problem: each one
// normalizes its native markup into @name tokens and then calls this package,
// which knows only the normalized grammar. That split is what keeps the
// stripping rules — mid-sentence mentions, repeated mentions, the trailing colon
// people type after a name — in one tested place instead of three.
//
// Stripping matters more than it looks. Text arrives as "@docs-bot summarize
// this" and the agent must be prompted with "summarize this": leaving its own
// name in makes the model answer as if it were being addressed in the third
// person, and leaving the raw <@U08BOT> in leaks an opaque id into the prompt.
//
// This package is a leaf: stdlib only.
