// Package inbound is the front door every webhook trigger shares: authenticate
// the request, then hand the raw bytes to whoever knows how to read them.
//
// # The order is the security property
//
// A webhook trigger has no session and no handshake. The only evidence that a
// POST came from Slack rather than from anyone who learned the URL is a MAC over
// the exact bytes of the body, so the bytes are verified before anything looks
// at them. Gate.Body enforces that ordering structurally: it returns bytes only
// after a Verifier accepted them, and a handler that wants the payload has no
// other way to get it.
//
// An absent Verifier is a configuration error, not a permissive setting: a gate
// with no verifier refuses every request. The alternative — treating "no secret
// configured" as "accept everything" — turns a missing environment variable into
// an open door that starts agent runs, and agent runs use tools.
//
// # The Ingest/ServeHTTP seam
//
// pkg/connector's Trigger face is a blocking Ingest that emits into a channel,
// while an HTTP webhook is a handler that is called by a server the trigger does
// not own. Pipe joins the two: Ingest parks on Pipe.Serve, holding the channel,
// and each request hands its tag to Pipe.Send. Before Ingest is called, or after
// it returns, Send reports ErrNotIngesting and the handler answers 503 — which
// for all three providers means "retry", and their retry carries the same event
// identifier, so the tag is not lost and does not duplicate.
//
// This package is stdlib plus pkg/envelope. It deliberately does not import
// pkg/signature: it declares the one-method interface that package's verifiers
// satisfy, so a connector can be given any authenticator, and a change to the
// signature package cannot break the mesh.
