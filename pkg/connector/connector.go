// Package connector defines what it means to participate in the mesh.
//
// A connector is a peer, not a client. It may implement up to three faces,
// and which ones it implements is what gives the mesh its shape:
//
//	Trigger  raises tags   (a Slack mention, a GitHub review request, a schedule)
//	Sink     receives events (a Slack thread, a GitHub comment, a webhook POST)
//	Actor    contributes actions the agent can call (transition a Jira ticket)
//
// The faces are independent, and most connectors do not implement all three:
//
//	slack    trigger + sink + actor
//	github   trigger + sink + actor
//	jira     trigger + sink + actor
//	cron     trigger only          — a schedule has no surface to deliver to
//	webhook  sink only             — an outbound POST raises nothing
//
// Because Trigger and Sink are separate faces rather than two halves of one
// request, a tag raised in GitHub can deliver into Jira, and a cron schedule
// that no human touched can deliver into both. No connector ever calls
// another connector: sources publish, sinks subscribe, and the bus is the
// only thing in between.
//
// The Actor face is what turns "the agent replied" into "the work got done".
// Actions are the connector's native verbs, executed under the agent's policy
// rather than freely, and each one that runs emits an action.taken event so
// the work is auditable on the same bus as the conversation.
