// Package signature authenticates inbound webhook requests.
//
// This is a security boundary, and for a webhook-style trigger it is the only
// one. There is no session and no handshake: the sole evidence that a POST
// came from Slack or GitHub, rather than from anyone on the internet who
// learned the URL, is a MAC over the raw request body computed with a shared
// secret. A run, the agent's tools, and whatever those tools are allowed to do
// all hang off this check returning nil, so it fails closed on every
// ambiguity. A missing header, a duplicated header, an unparseable digest, an
// unconfigured secret, and a wrong digest all return an error; nothing returns
// nil on doubt.
//
// # The caller's obligations
//
// Verify the bytes you received, before you interpret them.
//
//	body, err := io.ReadAll(http.MaxBytesReader(w, r.Body, maxBody))
//	if err != nil {
//		http.Error(w, "bad request", http.StatusBadRequest)
//		return
//	}
//	if err := verifier.Verify(r.Header, body); err != nil {
//		http.Error(w, "unauthorized", statusFor(err))
//		return
//	}
//	var payload eventPayload            // only now, on bytes known to be authentic
//	if err := json.Unmarshal(body, &payload); err != nil { ... }
//
// Two rules follow from the MAC covering exact bytes:
//
//   - Verify BEFORE parsing. Unmarshalling first runs attacker-controlled
//     input through a decoder and, worse, tempts a handler into reading a
//     field ("it's just the event type") before anything has been
//     authenticated. A handler that acts on unverified input has already lost,
//     whatever it does afterwards.
//   - Hash the EXACT bytes received. Not a re-encoded struct, not a
//     whitespace-normalized copy, not a form-decoded map. None of those
//     reproduce the sender's digest, and the tempting fix — loosening the
//     comparison until it passes — deletes the boundary rather than fixing it.
//
// # Replay
//
// Slack signs a timestamp alongside the body and documents a five minute
// replay window, so a captured request stops being useful once it ages out;
// Slack enforces that here (see Slack.Window).
//
// GitHub signs the body alone. A GitHub webhook carries no timestamp in the
// signing base string, so a captured request stays valid for as long as the
// secret does and no amount of code in this package can change that. The
// honest statement of where that defense lives: downstream, in Tag.ID
// idempotency. A replayed or redelivered GitHub event carries the same
// delivery identity, which becomes the run's idempotency key, so it joins the
// run that already exists instead of starting a second one. Verification
// answers "did GitHub send these bytes"; idempotency answers "how many times
// does that count".
//
// # Orthogonality
//
// This package knows about bytes, headers, secrets, and a clock. It knows
// nothing about topics, envelopes, connectors, or what a verified request
// should become — connectors own that. It only answers whether the claimed
// sender sent exactly these bytes, and for Slack, whether it did so recently.
//
// Verifiers are immutable once constructed and safe for concurrent use.
//
// This package is a leaf: stdlib only.
